This repo does the following:
1. Reads the CSV file from a folder
2. Add the CSV file headers to a database store
3. Based on the parameter only store either the odd or even rows in the database
4. If parameter is not passed in then insert all rows into the database
5. Return the CSV rows (all, even, or odd rows based on parameter) as a String Array
6. At least one unit test to verify the logic.
