This repo does the following:
Reads the CSV file from a folder
Add the CSV file headers to a database store
Based on the parameter only store either the odd or even rows in the database
If parameter is not passed in then insert all rows into the database
Return the CSV rows (all, even, or odd rows based on parameter) as a String Array
At least one unit test to verify the logic.
